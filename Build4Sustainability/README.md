**Calling all Embedded Systems and IOT Enthusiasts**

Techrity is a proud sponsor of #CodeFest2021 Build4Sustainability Hackathon.

The **CODEFEST** MAKE-A-THON (making + marathon) Sponsored by [Techrity Innovation Foundation](https://techrity.org) is a new format to create not only new ideas for products but also to realize physical prototypes within a total of 30 hours. The teams made up of young adults and embedded systems enthusiasts, have to understand the challenge centered around the theme for the program “Build for Sustainability”, generate and select ideas, and then realize prototypes built from the materials made available to them. At the end of the process, they have six minutes to pitch their products and services to the jury and explain why their solution will change and improve their communities and potentially be sustainable businesses.

The make-A-thon will be featuring two projects which the makers will select, and have to produce prototypes for, within the stipulated time frame, these projects include the following;

- **The Bonny Sustainable City (BSC)**
- **Smart waste management system (SWM)**.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Smart waste management system (SWM).

As the population in our communities keeps growing, so does their collective creation of increasingly large amounts of trash and litter. Cities, towns, villages, and countries are all trying to keep up with this, but are having a hard time. This is one of the reasons why there is a so-called ‘’plastic soup’’ floating in the oceans and why microplastic kills thousands of animals every year. So, what can be done? Smart waste management is an important part of the solution.
 
> Where do people leave their litter when they aren’t home and the trash cans on the street are full? You guessed it, on the street itself. Municipalities have a hard time keeping up with these outdoor bins because it is very difficult to figure out when to empty them or whether they are full or not at all.  

Everything's getting smarter right? So why not your trash bin? This trash bin opens and closes its lid if it sees any rubbish in front of it. You just need to bring the rubbish to it and it'll open automatically and will wait for you to feed it more than after a certain delay it'll close automatically.

The smart bin will contact its user once it is full with a notification message on your android device and SWM will reject any rubbish once it is full.

### The Bonny Sustainable City (BSC)

Smart cities use IoT devices such as connected sensors, lights, and meters to collect and analyze data. The cities then use this data to improve infrastructure, public utilities and services, and more. 

> The main goal of a smart city is to optimize city functions and promote economic growth while also improving the quality of life for citizens by using smart technologies. A smart city is central to achieving Goal 11 “sustainable cities and communities” of the sustainable development goals.

The makers will be tasked with building a miniaturized city rigged with smart technology (smart traffic light, motion detectors, solar sensors, etc.) and all powered by solar energy.
The aim of the make-a-thon is to Inspire, Educate and engage productivity amongst young technologists and entrepreneurs in the ecosystem thereby sustaining the Vision and the Ecosystem.
